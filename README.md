desec_dyndns
============

Simple client for the awesome DynDNS service offered by https://desec.io.

Why?
 * My router can update the desec records, but only with its own IP address, which is useless for IPv6
 * ddclient does not support dual IPv4 and IPv6 updating

Usage
-----

Edit desec_dyndns.py and run in a cronjob.
